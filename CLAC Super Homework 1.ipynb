In this homework, we'll set up your AWS account, test your boto3 connection, spin up EC2 instances and S3 buckets, and walk through the serverless stack. Seems like a lot? It is LOL this is three weeks worth of content. The due date isn't set in stone yet mostly because this is a thicc homework but I will be checking in every now and then to see how progress is going.\n",
